# R code <a name="Rcode"/>
This folder contains the R code to replicate the spatial multivariate models and to replicate and reproduce the simulation study described in the paper.

The code to replicate and reproduce the within prior simulation study can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Prior_Smoothing/tree/main/R/Within_SimulationStudy).

The code to replicate and reproduce the across priors simulation study can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Prior_Smoothing/tree/main/R/Across_SimulationStudy).

The code to replicate and reproduce the data illustration both for lung cancer in Spain and England can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Prior_Smoothing/tree/main/R/RealData_Illustration).
