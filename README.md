This folder contains the R code to replicate the spatial multivariate models and to replicate and reproduce the simulation study described in the paper.

The code to replicate the spatial multivariate models and the results obtained with German cancer data can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Prior_Smoothing/tree/main/R/Germany_data).
